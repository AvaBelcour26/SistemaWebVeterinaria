about.faq.title=Frequently Asked Questions
about.faq.q1=How can I schedule an appointment for my pet?
about.faq.a1=To schedule an appointment, you must first be registered and logged into the platform. Then, you will be able to access your user panel, register your pet if you haven't done so already, and select the service you need. The system will show you the available dates and times starting from the next day.
about.faq.q2=Can I book an appointment for the same day?
about.faq.a2=No. Due to how the system works, appointments must be scheduled at least one day in advance. That is, today you will only be able to see and reserve available times for tomorrow or later dates.
about.faq.q3=Can I register more than one pet in my account?
about.faq.a3=Yes, our platform allows each user to register multiple pets from their personal panel. You will be able to enter the data for each one (such as name, species, breed, age, etc.) and manage their appointments individually. This is ideal if you have several animals at home, as you can keep a separate track of the history of appointments and services used.
about.faq.q4=What happens if the service I need is not available?
about.faq.a4=If there is no availability for the service you want, the system will indicate it directly in the appointments panel. We recommend checking again later or choosing another date, as spaces are constantly updated according to demand.
